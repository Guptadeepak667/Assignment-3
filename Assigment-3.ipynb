    "Ans : \n",
    "Functions are advantageous to have in your programs for several reasons:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Modularity: Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each function can encapsulate a specific task or functionality, making your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. This modularity promotes code reusability and simplifies the development and debugging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Code Reusability: Once you've defined a function, you can call it multiple times throughout your program without having to rewrite the same code. This reduces redundancy and promotes efficient code reuse, saving time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: Functions provide a level of abstraction. You can use functions without needing to understand their internal implementation. This allows for clear separation between the \"what\" (the function's purpose) and the \"how\" (the actual code inside the function).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Testing and Debugging: Functions allow you to isolate specific pieces of code for testing and debugging. You can focus on individual functions, making it easier to identify and fix issues without affecting other parts of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Readability: Well-named functions improve code readability and maintainability. Functions with descriptive names serve as self-documenting units of code, making it clear what the code does without extensive comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Parameterization: Functions can take parameters (input values) and return results. This allows you to create flexible and dynamic code that can adapt to different situations. Parameters enable you to pass data to a function, and return values allow a function to communicate its results back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Scoping: Functions create their own variable scope, preventing naming conflicts between variables with the same name in different functions. This local scope ensures that variables within a function do not interfere with variables outside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Code Organization: Functions help organize your code logically. You can group related code into functions, making it easier to locate and manage specific parts of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Collaboration: In collaborative software development, functions allow different team members to work on separate components of a program independently. Each person can focus on their assigned functions, leading to more efficient teamwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Testing Isolation: Functions can be unit-tested in isolation, allowing you to test individual pieces of your code without running the entire program. This aids in identifying and fixing issues early in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Code Documentation: Functions can be documented with docstrings, which provide information about their purpose, parameters, and expected return values. This documentation helps other developers understand how to use the functions effectively.\n"

    "However, the code inside the function is not executed at this point; it's only defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Function Call: To execute the code within the function, you need to call the function by using its name followed by parentheses.\n",
